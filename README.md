# Adventure Works Dashboard



## Problem Statement

The AdventureWorks database is widely used in data engineering and analytics for tasks like querying, reporting, building dashboards, and even advanced data warehousing.
I wanted to demonstrate my skills in dimention modeling(star schema and snowflake schema), data analysis and visualization using a great tool like power BI.
We had data about sales , customers , returns ,territory,product, product categories, product subcategories. 
The pusrpose was to analyze this data and make a dashboard to serve executive needs by summarizing this data to make valuable insights.


### Steps followed 
1- Previewing data and ensuring data quality  
2-Creating calculated columns to support our analysis  
3-Data modeling (Snowflake schema)  
4-Creating measures using DAX functions  
5-Building the dashboard
